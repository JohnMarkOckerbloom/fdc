# Free decimal correspondence
# based on Melvil Dewey's decimal classification, 11th edition (1922)
# updated for modern terminology, drawing in part on LC authorities
# and checked and adjusted for compatibility with modern decimal
# call numbers by browsing Free Library of Philadelphia
# and other decimally arranged libraries.
# Current DDC thousands checked only for excluding unassigned units
# (necessary for compatibility).
#
# This set is currently fully defined down to the tens level,
# and in some ranges defined down to the units level,
# but expanded a little further in some places, and for
# concepts identified as important by various repositories
# and users.
#
# Lines are formatted as [number] [terms] or [range] [terms].
# Terms that are authorized LCSH headings are in quotation marks.
# + separates two different subjects that both use a particular
# number of range; | separates two ways of expressing the same subject.
